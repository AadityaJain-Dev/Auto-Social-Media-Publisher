2. You must have a PhantomJsCloud account. If you dont have one, follow this url https://phantomjscloud.com/ and create an account.
3. You must have an account for hosting this PHP script. There are hundreds of free PHP hosting providers you can choose any.

After you registering yourself on zoho, connect your social media profiles with your zoho account.
Paste your PhantomJsCloud API key in the script, paste your zoho username & password in the script & then choose a secret key and write it in the script and save it.
Now upload the script on your hosting account & done.
