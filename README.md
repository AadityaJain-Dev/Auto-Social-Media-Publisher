You can use these scripts for remotely publishing stuff on your social media profile & pages.

With a free zoho social account you can connect a **Facebook Page**, a **Facebook Group**, a **Twitter Profile**, a **Linkedin Profile**, a **Linkedin Company Page**, **Google My Business** & a **Instagram Profile** and publish stuff on all of them with a simple click.

**Note**:   Zoho team said they will release their public API's in Q1 of 2020, their API's will make remotely publishing stuff even more easy. Will update this repo when they release those API publicly.

**Note 2**:   PhantomJsCloud dosent support file upload so, you cant use instagram with this script. Their team said they are working on file upload handling and will add it soon (for paid users), until then you can use puppeteer on AWS lambda for publishing post with image.
