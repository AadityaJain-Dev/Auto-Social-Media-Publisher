1. Open "puppeteer-script.js" replace "YOUR-ZOHO-USERNAME" with your zoho username & "YOUR-ZOHO-PASSWORD" with your password.
2. open Terminal & execute "node index.js"



Note: With puppeteer we can also handle File uploads, this function as of now is not available in PhantomJsCloud, the support team said they are working on it & hopefully add it in few months.
