1. Open "reques.json" replace "YOUR-ZOHO-USERNAME" with your zoho username & "YOUR-ZOHO-PASSWORD" with your password.
2. Open "command.txt" replace "YOUR-API-KEY" with your PhantomJSCloud API key & copy the whole command and then paste it in the terminal


Note: Handling file uploads as of now is not available in PhantomJsCloud, the support team said they are working on it & hopefully add it in few months.

Note 2: You can change the value of maxWait, i have set it to 70000ms or 70sec just in case if you want to publish a very long post.
